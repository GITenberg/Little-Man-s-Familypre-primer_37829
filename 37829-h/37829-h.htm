<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>This pre-primer is one of three little books based on material
prepared by J. B. Enochs, who once taught in the sanitarium
school at Kayenta. It deals entirely with typical life experiences
among the Navaho, the largest Indian tribe in the
United States, numbering approximately 65,000. Nine out of
ten Navahos do not speak English, and the tribe has never had
a written language.</p>

<p>Missionaries and scientists for many years have had alphabets
with which to record this difficult language. But these
alphabets have usually included letters not found in English,
and have been peppered with diacritical marks to indicate
inflection, tonal change and nasalization. Thus they proved
too complicated for popular use. Space does not permit mention
of many who have worked with the Navaho language. Finally
Dr. John Harrington, of the Smithsonian Institution, and Mr.
Oliver LaFarge, author and linguist, collaborated to produce
a simplified alphabet which might be written with an ordinary
typewriter. Mr. Robert W. Young, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'assocate'">associate</ins> of Dr. Harrington,
experimentally recorded a great deal of material in this new
alphabet. The Navaho portions of later pamphlets in this bi-lingual
series are the joint work of Harrington and Young.
<b>Little Man's Family</b> has been expressed in Navaho, using the
Harrington-LaFarge alphabet, by Willetto Antonio, a Navaho
teacher on the reservation, and Dr. Edward Kennard, formerly
a specialist in Indian languages for the Indian Service. Both
the recordings and the interpretation in these books have been
checked by Chic Sandoval, Howard Gorman, and Adolph Bitanny,
Navaho interpreters, and by Robert W. Young. Back pages contain
an explanation of the sound values represented by the alphabet,
and the indications of tonal change and nasalization which
are used.</p>

<p>These bi-lingual texts are an attempt to speed up Indian understanding
of modern life. Use of native languages to speed up
acquisition of English in Federal schools is a new departure in
Indian policy, which has proved very successful.</p>

<p>The type used for these books has been selected because of
its similarity in design to the alphabet used for manuscript writing.
In the primers, only proper names and the pronoun I have
to be capitalized, so as to further minimize the new learnings
often encountered by the primary child when faced with several
different alphabets at once.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NAVAHO_ALPHABET" id="THE_NAVAHO_ALPHABET"></a>THE NAVAHO ALPHABET</h2>


<p>The following information with regard to the Navaho alphabet
and its use should prove helpful to one familiar with the English
language.</p>


<h4>VOWELS</h4>

<p>The vowels have continental values. They are as follows, the
first example being a Navaho word, the second the closest
approximation to the sound in an English word:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>a</td><td>gad (juniper)</td><td>father</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">e</td><td align="left">ké (shoe)</td><td align="left">met</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">i</td><td align="left">sis (belt) or as in<br />dishááh (I'm starting)</td><td align="left">sit or as in<br />pique</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">o</td><td align="left">doo (not)</td><td align="left">note</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Vowels may be either long or short in duration, the long vowel
being indicated by a doubling of the letter. This never affects
the quality of the vowel, except that long i is always pronounced
as in pique.</p>


<div class="table">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">sis (belt) is short</td><td align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left">siziiz (my belt) is long</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Vowels with a hook beneath the letter are nasalized. That
is, some of the breath passes through the nose in their production.
After n, all vowels are nasalized and are not marked.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">tsinaab&#261;&#261;s</td><td align="left">(wagon)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">jí&#808;</td><td align="left">(day)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">kó&#808;ó&#808;</td><td align="left">(here)</td></tr>
</table></div>


<h4>DIPHTHONGS</h4>

<p>The diphthongs are as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">ai</td><td align="left">hai (winter)</td><td align="left">aisle</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">ei</td><td align="left">séí (sand)</td><td align="left">weigh</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">oi</td><td align="left">'ayóí (very)</td><td align="left">Joey</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>The diphthongs oi (as in Joey) will frequently be heard as ui
(as in dewy) in certain sections of the reservation. However,
since the related word ayóó is always of one value, this spelling
has been standardized.</p>

<p>In a similar way, the diphthongs ei and ai are not universally
distinguished. For example, the word for sand, séí will be pronounced
sáí by some Navahos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<h4>CONSONANTS</h4>

<p>The consonants are as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">b</td><td align="left">bá (for him)</td><td align="left">like</td><td align="left">p</td><td align="left">in spot</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">d</td><td align="left">díí (this)</td><td align="left">like</td><td align="left">t</td><td align="left">in stop</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">g</td><td align="left">gah (rabbit)</td><td align="left">like</td><td align="left">k</td><td align="left">in sky</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>These sounds are not truly voiced as are the sounds represented
by these letters in English, but are like the wholly unaspirated
p, t, and k in the English words given as examples.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">t</td><td align="left">tó (water)</td><td align="left">tea</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">k</td><td align="left">ké (shoe)</td><td align="left">kit</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The t and k in Navaho are much more heavily aspirated than
in the English words given in the examples, so that the aspiration
has a harsh fricative quality.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">'</td><td align="left">glottal stop</td><td align="left">yá'át'ééh (it is good)</td><td align="left">unh unh, oh oh</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In the American colloquial negative unh unh, and in the exclamatory
expression oh oh, the glottal stop precedes the u and
the o respectively. Or, in actual speech, the difference between
Johnny earns and Johnny yearns, is that the former has a glottal
closure between the two words.</p>

This sound is made with the tongue in exactly the same position
as in the ordinary l, but the voice box or larynx does not
function. The difference between these two l's is the same as
the difference between the b and p, d and t, or s and z. If one
attempts to pronounce th as in thin followed by l without an
intervening vowel a &#322; is produced. Thus ath&#322;ete.</p>

<p>In Navaho there are two sounds represented by the letter h.
The difference is in the intensity or fricativeness. Where h is the
first letter in a syllable it is by some pronounced like the ch of German.
This harsh <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pronounciation'">pronunciation</ins> is the older, but the younger generation
of Navahos tends to pronounce the sound much as in
English.</p>

<h4>PALATALIZATION AND LABIALIZATION</h4>

<p>It is to be noted that the sounds represented by g, t, k, h, gh,
and ch, ts (when heavily aspirated) are palatalized before e, i,
and labialized before o. By this it is meant that such a word
as ké (shoe) is pronounced as though it were written kyé, and
tó (water) as though written twó.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the gh sound, it practically resolves itself
into a w when followed by o. Thus tálághosh (soap) could
be written táláwosh, yishgho&#322; (I'm running) as yishwo&#322; etc.</p>

<p>k and h can also be pronounced as kw and hw before e, i,
in which case the combination is a distinct phoneme. In such
cases the w must be written. Thus kwe'é (here), kwii (here),
hwii (satisfaction) etc.</p>


<h4>TONE</h4>

<p>The present system of writing Navaho employs only one diacritical
to express four tonal variations. This is the acute accent
mark (´). If a short vowel or n, both elements of a long vowel or
a diphthong are marked thus the tone indicated is high. If only
the first element of a long vowel or diphthong is marked the tone
is falling from high, and if only the last element is marked the
tone is rising from low. When a vowel, diphthong or n is unmarked
the tone is low. The difference between low and high
tone in Navaho is similar to the difference in tone of "are you"
and "going" in the English question "are you going?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">'azee'</td><td align="left">(medicine) low tone</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">'azéé'</td><td align="left">(mouth) high tone</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">háadish?</td><td align="left">(where?) falling tone</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">shínaaí</td><td align="left">(my elder brother) rising tone</td></tr>
</table></div>


<h4>WORD AND SENTENCE STRUCTURE</h4>

<p>Teachers will note that the possessive pronouns of Navaho
are always prefixed to the noun. Thus, we have shimá (my
mother), nimá (your mother), bimá (his mother), but never má.
The stem -má has no independent form and never occurs without
a prefix.</p>

<p>The structure of the Navaho verb has similar characteristics,
but is more complex. The subject of the sentence is always
incorporated in the verb with a pronominal form, and other verbal
elements. Ideas of time and mode are likewise incorporated in
the verb, and auxiliary verbs such as will, did, have, might, etc.
do not occur in Navaho. The ideas conveyed by these independent
words in English are expressed by different forms of the
verb itself in Navaho.</p>

<p>Another point in which Navaho sentence structure differs from
English is that English prepositions are postpositions in Navaho.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="left">with my elder sister</td><td align="left">shádí bi&#322; (my elder sister, with her)</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">for my mother</td><td align="left">shimá bá (my mother for)</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>whereas normal word order in English is subject, verb, and
object, Navaho has subject, object, and verb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
